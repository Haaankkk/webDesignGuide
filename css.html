        <div class="section one">
            <h2>
                Basic Syntax and Adding to your HTML:
            </h2>
            <p>
                CSS uses selectors. Each selector in CSS has one or more property-value pairs. Please use external
                stylesheet to connect your HTML and CSS!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section two">
            <h2>
                Elements Type:
            </h2>
            <p>
                We have two types of element in CSS: inline and block. Besides, we can combine these two (inline-block)
                to create an element that has the property of inline element and block element.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section three">
            <h2>
                The Position Property:
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are five types of position property: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. You will use
                static and relative more often. The default type is "static" (everything will just start at the upper
                left-hand corner). If you want to decide the location by your own, please use "relative."
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section four">
            <h2>
                Floats:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Floats help you to insert pictures in next to texts. You can also use it to create sidebars. Remember to
                clear floats!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section five">
            <h2>
                Responsive Design:
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you want to create a responsive web, you need to consider flowing methods: flexible layout, scalable
                media, and media queries.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section six">
            <h2>
                Flexbox:
            </h2>
            <p>
                A way to organize your containers. Your items in that container can be organized easily by using
                flexbox. Try it: "display: flex;"
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section seven">
            <h2>
                Grid:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Similar to flexbox, but this time you can organize your items in two dimensions. A better way to use
                grid is to combine grid and media queries.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section eight">
            <h2>
                Aesthetics:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can edit the color and font of your web. Also, you can add background gradient and filters.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section nine">
            <h2>
                Transitions, Transifroms, and Animations:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can use transition to add a transition to your property. You can use transform to change the shape
                and location of an element. And, you can use animation to create different more complex effects.
