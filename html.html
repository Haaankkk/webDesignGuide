            <p>
                A single HTML document consists of many elements. 
                <br>An element is always started and ended by tags. Between the opening tag and the closing tag is the content. 
                <br>We can add attributes that contain extra information in the opening tag and even nest some elements together.

                For headers: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
                <br>For paragraph: p.
                <br>For images: img with attributes src and alt.
                <br>For links: a with attribute href. 
                <br>For unordered lists: ul. For ordered lists: ol. For list item: li.
                <br>There are also specific element names to distinguish the whole flow of a website, including header, nav, main, footer.
                <br>When writing the HTML file, it is always better to use these elements than using the general div elements.

                Ways to add content outside HTML
            </h2>
            <p>
                Instead of putting images and links directly into our HTML files, we use their paths to represent them.
                <br>There are two types of paths.
                <br>Relative path indicates the place within our root directary.
                <br>Absolute path leads to the location in the Internet. 
                <br>Relative path is more stable, while absolute path is easier to find.

                How to check up markup of HTML documents
            </h2>
            <p>
                We need to check the syntax of our codes after finishing coding. 
                <br> <a href="https://validator.w3.org">Markup Validator website</a> is a useful tool.

                Comments
            </h2>
            <p>
                Comments are important in HTML to clarify the meaning of the code. <br>In HTML, we simply use "< !--" and " -->" to add comments.

                We can even add forms to interact with our audience under the help of HTML file. The form below is an example.
